This program is a rewrite of a Roulette program I found from a book called 
"55 Advanced Computer Programs in BASIC" from William Scott Watson.

I rewrote the program for Apple One BASIC. Apple One BASIC is extremely limited
as it does not include many of the functions as a modern BASIC. DATA and READ
are non exsistant and I had to change how the program functions by using strings
instead of data values. The use of strings allows me to make arrays.

You can find the [original version](https://archive.org/details/55_Advanced_Computer_Programs_in_BASIC_1981_Tab_Books/page/n142/mode/1up)

You can run the code from Apple 1js Emulator from [Sculinsteel](https://www.scullinsteel.com/apple1/)

Thank you to William Scott Watson, Will Scullin, and The Woz
